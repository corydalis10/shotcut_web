Version 25.01.25 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

### New Stuff

- Added **Bins** and media type & text search to **Playlist**.
- Added **View > Files** panel.
- Added **Show in Files** to **Properties** and **Jobs**.
- Added **HSL Primaries** and **HSL Range** video filters (HSL = Hue/Saturation/Lightness).
- Added **Gradient Map** video filter.
- Added **Settings > Player > Pause After Seek** toggle that defaults to on (old behavior).
- Added a **Type** parameter to **Fade In Audio** and **Fade Out Audio** filters.
- Added **Export** hardware encoding for Windows on Arm CPUs (`h264_mf` and `hevc_mf` codecs).
- Added **Settings > Language > Irish**.
- Improved support for MLT XML clip/sub-projects:
  Now more tolerant to inconsistent video modes, there are **Properties**, and you can add a **Speed: Forward Only** time filter.
  
### Fixes and Changes

- Improved **Playlist > Generate Slideshow** with trimmed video clips making it more useful to make a montage.
- Fixed incorrect color change when mixing video tracks and certain filters such as **Hue/Lightness/Saturation**.
- Fixed scrub bar and Timeline & Keyframes rulers not using **Settings > Time Format**.
- Fixed **File > Export > Markers as Chapters** when **Settings > Time Format** is not **Clock**.
- Fixed **Subtitles** works incorrectly after a couple of minutes with non-integer frame rates.
- Fixed **Settings > Clear Recent on Exit** not clearing the **Projects** list.
- Fixed **View > Application Log > Previous** not appearding on Windows.
- Fixed changing **Properties > Duration** of image on **Timeline** not adjusting video filters keyframes.
- Fixed **Properties > Export GPX** not working with GoPro HERO 11, 12 & 13.
- Fixed **Export > Presets > lossless > H.264** with NVIDIA hardware encoder.
- Fixed "Use font size" in **Text: Simple**, **GPS Text**, **Subtitle Burn In** and **Timer** filters not applying from a saved preset.
- Fixed the color picker (pick color from screen) when Shotcut is not on the primary screen.
- Fixed the color picker on the Wayland graphics subsystem in Linux.
- Fixed drag-n-drop from the **Source** player on Wayland for Linux.
- Added native support for Wayland (without Xwayland) in the Flatpak for Linux.
- Fixed unable to extend duration of text clips made by **Subtitles > Generate Text on Timeline**.
- Fixed **Properties > Convert** job progress when deinterlacing or changing frame rate.
- Fixed the subtitle track and times on ruler disapper when **Timeline** is floated.
- Fixed the **Delete** and **Clear** actions in the **Text: Rich** editor not working.
- Export preset **H.264 High Profile** now defaults to a higher quality 65% than YouTube or the defaults.
- Removed **File > Open Other > JACK Audio** on Linux to remove the hard run-time dependency on `libjack.so` for Shotcut. However, that library is still needed to get some of the bundled audio filters (unless they load from system-installed "swh" LADSPA plugins).
- Improved support for `pix_fmt=yuv420p10le` or `yuv444p10le`, `colorspace=2020`, `color_trc=arib-std-b67` or `smpte2084` in **Export > Other** for 10-bit pass-through (i.e. no image effects) editing without GPU Effects (i.e. rudimentary HDR editing without adequate preview).
- Upgraded dependencies:
  - MLT 7.30.0
  - Qt 6.8.1
  - dav1d 1.5.0
  - AOM AV1 3.11.0
  - OpenCV 4.10
  - libvpx 1.15.0
  - Opus 1.5.2
  - WebP 1.5.0
