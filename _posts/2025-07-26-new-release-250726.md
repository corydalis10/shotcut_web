<div style="margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em">
  1 hot for the new <strong>Speech to Text</strong> model downloader<br>

  3 hots for your CPU cooking on the new <strong>Outline</strong> video filter!<br>

</div>

- Added a Whisper.cpp (GGML) model downloader to the **Speech to Text** dialog.  
  A model is no longer included in the download and installation reducing their sizes.

- Improved the **System** theme to follow the operating system palette on Windows (darker and more contrast), and improved its appearance on macOS dark mode.

- Added **Settings > Theme > System Fusion** that combines the operating *system* palette with the monochrome, symbolic icons of the *Fusion* themes.

</div>

- Added an **Outline** video filter that uses the input alpha channel--useful with rich text or assets with a transparent background.  
  This means that, like **Drop Shadow**, it will not work as expected when used after a text filter on a video or image clip. Rather, you must use a text clip (transparent color generator with text filter) on an upper track.

### Other New Features

- Added the ability to drag the waveform peak line to adjust audio gain.
- Added **Settings > Timeline > Adjust Clip Gain/Volume** to turn off the above.
- Added rolling an edit/trim to **Timeline**:  
  Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (<kbd>command</kbd> on macOS) while trimming to simultaneously trim the neighbor clip.
- Added a **Soft Focus** filter set.
- Added **Audio/Video duration** to the **Slideshow Generator** dialog, defaults to 4 hours.  
  This facilitates using **Slideshow Generator** to make transitions between everything when including both video and images. (It still respects the source duration and in &amp; out points; duration here is a maximum.)

### Surround Sound Mixing Improvements

- Added fader and surround balance to the **Balance** audio filter if channels > 2.
- Added **Channels** toggle buttons to many audio filters:
  * Band Pass
  * Compressor
  * Delay
  * Downmix
  * Equalizer: 3-Band
  * Equalizer: 15-Band
  * Equalizer: Parametric
  * Expander
  * Gain/Volume
  * High Pass
  * Low Pass
  * Limiter
  * Mute
  * Noise Gate
  * Notch
- Added support for 4 channels in the **Copy Channel** audio filter.

For example, now you can:
- Copy stereo music to the rear channels and use the fader in the **Balance** filter to reduce its volume,
- **Downmix** spoken word into the center channel and apply a **Band Pass** filter to it, and
- Route music or sound effects to the low-frequency channels and apply a **Low Pass** filter to it.

### Other Improvements

- Changed the default **Export > Audio > Rate control** to **Average Bitrate** for AAC, Opus, and MP3.
- Added the ability to add/use multiple **Mask: Apply** filters.
- Added support for **Scrub While Dragging** to trimming on the timeline.
- Added hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to ripple-trim when **Ripple** is turned off.
- Added **French (Canadian)** and **Lithuanian** translations.
