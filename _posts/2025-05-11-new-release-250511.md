Version 25.05.11 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

### New Features

- Added **Alpha Strobe** video filter.
- Added **Freeze Frame** to **Timeline**.
- Added **File > Rereun Filter Analysis**.
- Added adjustable track headers width to **Timeline**.
- Added an item count to **Playlist**.
- Added **File > New** submenu with items for **Project** and generators.
- Added **Add Generator** to **Timeline** toolbar.
- Changed the **Convert to Edit-friendly** dialog to make it obvious that "better" and "best" options create very large files.
- Added **Settings > Preview Scaling > 1080p**. (This was added primarily for use with DeckLink SDI/HDMI external monitoring.)
- Added **Settings > Player > External Monitor > DeckLink Gamma** with SDR and HLG HDR options.
- Added HLG color transfer/gamma to **GPU Effects**. HDR is not ready to announce; these are just some pieces.

### Improvements

- Improved compositing in **Obscure With Blur**, **Obscure With Mosaic**, and **Mask: Apply**. Now, they are better at concealing details.
