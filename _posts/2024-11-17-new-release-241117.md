Version 24.11.17 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

This version is simply a collection of fixes:

- Fixed **Convert** stopped converting variable frame rate to constant (broke in v24.10).
- Fixed filter in and out points when you resize transition by moving a clip (broke in v24.10).
- Fixed **Reframe** loses its keyframes in **Export** (broke in v24.10).
- Fixed moving a clip immediately after a transition beyond another clip stopped working (broke in v24.10).
- Fixed **Settings > Time Format > Timecode (Non-Drop Frame)** for other non-integer frame rates such as 23.98 fps.
- Fixed using **Export > From > Marker** with subtitles creates a bad output (broke in v24.08).
- Fixed a video transition between sources with alpha channel is more translucent than expected.
- Fixed a crash adding **MLT XML As a Clip** to a **Timeline** with a higher frame rate.
- Fixed **View > Resources > Convert** negatively affects color if input is not HDR.
- Fixed **Export > Video > Aspect ratio** immediately after you toggle **Use hardware encoder**.
- Fixed possible crash on **File > New** or **File > Close**.
- Fixed possible crash dragging a MLT XML file to **Playlist** of a new project/session.
- Fixed changing **Properties > Audio > Track > All** to something else not working.
