Version 24.10.29 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

### Speech to Text 

Shotcut gets its first AI based on [OpenAI's Whisper](https://openai.com/index/whisper/),
courtesy of the [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) project.
This is available through **Subtitles > Speech to Text** menu item or button: <kbd><img alt="Speech to Text icon" src="https://d2t917e3b1b2xy.cloudfront.net/original/3X/8/2/8280d8783625e9b235728767f702e2e80abe3714.png" width="32" height="32"></kbd>.

  - Our builds include a basic model that has decent speed and accuracy but not a big size. (You can think of the model as the brain.)
  - You can [download](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main) a bigger and better better brain (model) in `ggml` format and configure it in the **Speech to Text** dialog, but it will be slower.
  - The dialog creates two jobs that appear in the **Jobs** panel: one to export audio and another to convert to text.
  - The results are added to the **Subtitles** panel as a new top-level Subtitle Track.
  - Currently, the only GPU our build supports is Apple Silicon. Otherwise, it is heavily multi-threaded on the CPU.
  - Known quirk: subtitle items sometimes start earlier than expected. Timing is provided by the model and tool, and we lack the skills and resources to improve this.
  - Expect there to be occasional errors. Like humans and non-ideal conditions, it is not perfect. We will not take action on bug reports about some piece of audio not converting to the expected text.
  - OpenAI has made some [warnings](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large#evaluated-use) about the usage of their Whisper models:  
  > In particular, we caution against using Whisper models to transcribe recordings of individuals taken without their consent.... We recommend against use in high-risk domains like decision-making contexts, where flaws in accuracy can lead to pronounced flaws in outcomes.

### Transition Improvements

  - **Ripple Delete** a transition restores the entirety of the clips included in the transition.
  - **Lift** (non-ripple delete) a transition no longer leaves a gap; the gap is filled with the adjacent clips.
  - Moving an adjacent clip away increases the transition duration instead of detaching and leaving a gap.

### Other Improvements
 
- Removed the **Export > Video > Resample** button. Now, there are simply ignorable inline warnings when making certain changes.
- Added **File > Show Project in Folder** to menu.
- Added a `decimals <number>` option to numeric keywords in the **GPS Text** video filter.
- Changed **Recent Projects** to **Projects**: items in this view no longer disappear as **Recent** reaches its maximum length and old items are removed.
- Added a **Remove** action to the context menu in **Projects**.
- Hide the **Reframe** video filter and button if **GPU Effects** is on.
- Upgraded FFmpeg to version 7.1.

### Fixes

- Fixed a crash doing when doing more than one **Playlist > menu > Add Selected to Slideshow**. In theory, this could fix other random crashes in **Timeline**.
- Fixed a crash opening a project containing a subtitle track with no items.
- Fixed odd value for computed width in **Reframe** output video filter causes export to fail.
- Fixed **Reframe** visual control can create odd-valued dimensions.
- Fixed AVCHD video frame rate is double (could fix other formats).
- Fixed making a proxy video for a iPhone 16 Pro video containing spatial audio.
- Fixed GPU filters paste below non-GPU filters.
- Fixed **Slideshow Generator** dialog is too tall with vertical video mode.
- Fixed **GPS Offset** would reset in **GPS Text** video filter.
- Fixed the maximum allowed **Time** in the **Time Remap** filter to prevent white frames.
