Version 24.01.28 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

### New Stuff

- Added **Player > Loop** (<kbd>\</kbd>) and **Player > Set Loop Range** to the menu and player controls.
- Added **Timeline > Selection > Group/Ungroup** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd>, <kbd>command</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd> on macOS).
  This is basically a saved multi-selection system. So, the operations it supports are all those available for multiple selection. That does not include trim, **Filters**, or **Properties** at this time.
  Hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> (<kbd>option</kbd> on macOS) to select an individual member of a group.
  Hold <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (<kbd>option</kbd>+<kbd>command</kbd> on macOS) to multi-select only certain members of a group.
- Added support for multiple selection to **Split At Playhead**.
- Added **Timeline > Edit > Split All Tracks At Playhead** (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>).
- Added **Edit > Undo** and **Redo** support for adding, removing, changing, and disabling **Filters**.
- Added **Timeline > Edit > Nudge Forward** (<kbd>.</kbd>) and **Nudge Backward** (<kbd>,</kbd>).
- Added **Pause** and **Resume** to the context menu in **Jobs**.
- Added **Settings > Backup** with options for:
  - **Manually**
  - **Hourly**
  - **Daily** (default)
  - **Weekly**
  This creates a backup of the current project file in a manner similar to **File > Backup and Save** except it is automatic now unless **Manually** is chosen.
- Added **File > Other Versions** submenu that tries to find similarly-named project files in the same folder create by Shotcut backup or recovery mechanisms.
- Added **Settings > Player > Audio API** on Linux and Windows.
  Basically, this makes the `--SDL_AUDIODRIVER` command line option available in the **Settings** menu.
- Added a **Previous** button to **View > Application Log** dialog that goes to the log file created by the previous app session.
  Now, on startup, Shotcut makes a backup of `shotcut-log.txt` to `shotcut-log.bak`.
- Added a **Copy** button to all text viewer dialogs that does the same thing that the non-obvious Select All and Copy actions in the context menu.
