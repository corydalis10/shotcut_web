Version 24.08.29 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

### Subtitles!

- Added **View > Subtitles**.
- Added **Subtitle Burn In** video filter (only works on **Output** track).

The **Subtitles** panel can be used to add subtitles to a project. Subtitles can only be added to the **Timeline**. They can not be added to the playlist or clips. We recommend to save subtitle editing until the timeline editing is complete because moving or cutting clips on the timeline will break the subtitle synchronization.

To start editing subtitles, click the "add" button and give the subtitle track and name and language. After the subtitle track is created the subtitle track area will appear in the timeline above the top video track. Multiple subtitle tracks can be added. But only the currently selected subtitle track is shown in the Subtitle Panel and the Timeline.

Click the "Add subtitle" button to make a new subtitle item at the cursor position. Then type in the "Current" text area to add the text.

Subtitles can also be imported. Supported subtitle import formats include: SRT, VTT, ASS, and SSA. Subtitles are imported at the current cursor position. So be sure to place the cursor before importing subtitles from a file.

#### Export

Subtitles can be exported to a file.  Subtitles are exported in SRT format.

When exporting a Shotcut project, subtitles will be embedded in the output file if the file format supports it. Formats that commonly support subtitles include MKV, MOV, and MP4.  You can disable this using the checkbox at the bottom of the **Export > Other** tab. You can also enter the text `sn=1` in the other box to disable them.

#### Subtitle Burn In Video Filter

The **Subtitle Burn In** filter can only be added to the **Output** track. The filter allows you to select an existing subtitle track, and overlay the subtitle text on the project video.

### Other Changes and Fixes

- Added a **Power (W)** ( `#gps_power#`) field to the **GPS Text** video filter.
- Now <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Return</kbd> in **Filters > search** changes focus to the search results.
- Now <kbd>Up</kbd> or <kbd>Down</kbd> in **Help > Actions and Shortcuts > search** changes focus to the search results.
- Changed the **Softness** to 0 in the **Obscure With Blur** and **Obscure With Mosaic** filter sets.
- Fixed the Linux portable, AppImage, and Snap fail to launch on some systems (e.g. Ubuntu 24.04) with Qt 6 and Wayland.
- Fixed occasional audio pop/click with some media files especially with uncompressed audio.
- Fixed lag in **Filters > search**.
- Fixed a disabled **Crop: Circle** or **Crop: Rectangle** video filter becomes enabled when reselected.
- Fixed the `hevc_toolbox` hardware video encoder fails detection on some Intel Macs.
- Fixed file dialogs open slowly in the Linux AppImage.
- Fixed overriding **Properties > Rotation** on a proxy video whose default is not 0 exports with wrong rotation.
  This bug affected the creation of the proxy and thus requires making a new proxy, which is easier said than done on Windows due to file locking. **Properties > Proxy > Disable Proxy** on the affected clips is a workaround if you do not turn off proxy completely.
- Fixed **Properties > Proxy > Make Proxy** does not override a DJI- or GoPro-provided proxy video.
- Fixed 59.94 fps in Matroska falsely identified as variable frame rate (broke in v24.06).
- Fixed mono audio assets not playing through both stereo channels (broken in v24.06).
- Fixed **Open Other > Audio/Video Device > Video Input** on macOS (broke in v24.06).
- Fixed spinboxes on **Settings > Theme > System** on Windows takes too much space from the numeric field (broke in v24.06).
- Fixed many audio filters missing for Windows on Arm computers (broke in v24.06).
- Fixed setting the audio language in **Export > Other** using `alang=`.
- Fixed right <kbd>Alt</kbd> key (AltGr) for text input in some languages instead keyboard shortcuts/actions in Windows.
- Fixed the **Convert** dialog when dropping hangs Windows Explorer until the dialog is closed.
- Fixed **Add Keyframe at Playhead** for some filters, for example **Color Grading**.
- Fixed enabling keyframes in **Color Grading** adds 2 keyframes.
- Fixed the modal font dialog on Linux can be behind main window making Shotcut not responsive.
- Upgraded MLT to version 7.26.0.
