### Windows on Arm

Hurrah for new Qualcomm Snapdragon X chip! Since there are now good Arm64 CPU systems for Windows,
we added a native build for Windows on Arm64 CPU. Treat this as a beta.
Known issues are there is no hardware encoder, and some audio filters are missing.

### New Stuff

- Added SVT-AV1 encoder (faster non-hardware AV1 encoder).
- Added support for AVIF (AV1) images.
- Added a **Drop Shadow** video filter that uses the input alpha channel. (This means that it will not work as expected when used after a text filter on a video clip; rather, you must use a text clip on an upper track.)
- Added a **Vibrance** video filter. This is similar to **Saturation**, but Vibrance is sensitive to the current saturation instead of adjusting all values equally as in saturation. This is especially helpful to prevent affecting skin tones.

- Added the **Mid-Side Matrix** audio filter for processing these kinds of microphones into proper stereo sound.
- Added **Keyframes > Scrub While Dragging**.
- Added **Playlist > menu > Columns**.
- Added support for DJI LRF (MP4) files as a proxy.
  
### Fixes and Changes

- Improved handling for some variable frame rate videos. Now, **Properties** tries to show the file's target frame rate and extends the variable detection logic to include strange average frame rate values (what previous versions showed in **Properties**).
- Changed **Playlist Tiles** view mode to show Date instead of In/Start.
- Fixed using graphics (text, image, etc.) on upper video track with **GPU Effects**.
- Fixed an off-by-one frame bug in the duration for Glaxnimate animations.
- Fixed **Undo** does not work for time filters.
- Fixed spamming (Undo) **History** when using the timeline fade controls.
- Fixed preview color with **GPU Effecs** is inaccurate.
- Fixed **Timeline > Select None** does not clear the **Filters** panel or VUI.
- Fixed single click does not reset a multi-selection.
- Fixed **Export > Codec > Quality** hint not updated after changing **Rate control**.
- Fixed **Properties > Proxy > Make** does not regenerate if already exists.
- Fixed changing **Properties** (except **Speed**) affects clips on other tracks with **Ripple All Tracks** turned on.
- Fixed drag from **Source** and drop to **Source** changes **Playlist**.
- Fixed **Automatically Add Tracks** changes the current video track, which can cause unexpected behavior with **Properties > Speed** change, for example.
- Fixed files generated automatically in the project folder (.stab, .rawr, etc.) are incorrectly generated in the app data's `autosave` folder in the app session immediately after Shotcut recovers an auto-saved project.
- Fixed changing **Properties** can delete a timeline clip.
- Fixed selected filter changes unexpectedly by changing tabs or clicking filter categories.
- Fixed **Properties > Audio > Track > All**.
- Fixed the project folder when running an autosave-recovered session.
- Fixed **Settings > Timeline > Auto Add Tracks** creates too many tracks when drop multiple clips to **Timeline**.
- Fixed new **Settings > Time Format** not used in several places.
- Fixed **View > Application Log > Previous** not working after the first time.
- Fixed **Properties > menu > View Bitrate** hiding the first second.
- Upgraded Qt to version 6.7 on macOS, Windows, and Flatpak.
- Upgraded dav1d to version 1.4.2.
- Upgraded FFmpeg to version 7.0.
- Upgraded OpenCV to version 4.9.0.
- Upgraded VMAF to version 3.0.0.
